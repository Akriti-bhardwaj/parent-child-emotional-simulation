A Flask-based interactive web simulation visualizing the emotional dynamics between a **parent and a child** during **competitive exam preparation** — showing how stress, empathy, and understanding influence one another in real time.  

---

## Overview  

This project represents the emotional connection between a parent and child — how their mental states fluctuate under pressure and how empathy helps balance stress.  
Each “simulation step” models a day of emotional interaction, demonstrating how supportive communication reduces tension and strengthens relationships.  

Built using **Flask (Python)** for backend logic and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the interactive visualization.

## Features  

- Dynamic visualization of emotional stress levels  
- Auto-simulation mode for continuous updates  
- Gradient-based stress indicators (green = calm, red = high stress)  
- Event generator for random emotional changes  
- Flask backend handling real-time updates  
- Clean, responsive frontend
