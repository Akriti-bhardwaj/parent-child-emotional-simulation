A Flask-based interactive web simulation visualizing the emotional dynamics between a **parent and a child** during **competitive exam preparation** — showing how stress, empathy, and understanding influence one another in real time.  

---

## 🧠 Overview  

This project represents the **emotional connection** between a parent and child — how their mental states fluctuate under pressure and how empathy helps balance stress.  
Each “simulation step” models a day of emotional interaction, demonstrating how **supportive communication** reduces tension and strengthens relationships.  

Built using **Flask (Python)** for backend logic and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the interactive visualization.

## ✨ Features  

- 🎯 **Dynamic visualization** of emotional stress levels  
- 🔁 **Auto-simulation mode** for continuous updates  
- 🌈 **Gradient-based stress colors** (green = calm, red = high stress)  
- 💬 **Event generator** for random emotional events  
- ⚙️ **Flask backend** handling state updates  
- 💻 **Clean, responsive frontend**
